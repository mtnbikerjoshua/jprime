You know when you decide to start blogging, but never get around to making your first post? Yeah...

Here are some topics I plan to blog about in the future:
- AI therapy - effective? Are robotic therapy tools an effective way to reach more people or a hindrance to human communication?
- My experience switching to full-time Linux
- Open source code in commercial applications
- Data Science: A Misnomer. Data science is a tool to help the other sciences.
- Are mental health disorders man-made?
