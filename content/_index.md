title: About Me
---

My name is Joshua Carpenter, and I'm a biostatistician using my technical skillset to mitigate childhood trauma and improve quality of life for children around the world. Despite my focus on data, I place high importance on interdisciplinary collaboration and close-up experience with public health issues. This website is my personal portfolio and is designed to showcase both my soft skills and my technical ones. I'm not only a statistician, but also an advocate for children, and I'll use all the skills I have at my disposal for that cause, from making a graph to telling a compelling story to caulking a window.

My current projects include providing trauma-informed care training to organizations in NYC, eradicating childhood malnutrition in Argentina, and researching the genetic transmission of obesity, as well as pursuing a Masters in Biostatistics from the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, graduating in May 2025.
